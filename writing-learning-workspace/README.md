# Writing Learning Workspace

I want to get better at communication. This means re-configuring how
my brain approach conversations, essays, and speeches.

The beauty of LLMs is its ability to talk back with the grammatical
wisdom of reinforcement learning and the vast web. People have used
ChatGPT as a therapist, as a teacher. I want to use a CLI based
chatbot to actively help me see where I'm making mistakes.

I'm creating an AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md file that forces me to follow
a certain guideline on writing. For example, I want my CLI coding
agent to ensure that I first think about the conclusion I reached
personally and the conclusion I want the reader to reach. Then,
I want to formulate exactly what I want to talk about and to consider
the details.

These CLI agents with Skills are a game changer for active feedback
loops with custom instructions.

This folder contains many drafts, attempts, conclusions per draft on
how well it's helping my writing over time.

It will also contain issues that OpenAI (and reader feedback) points out
after I finish writing so that I may learn retrospectively and to prevent
hindering publishing schedules.
